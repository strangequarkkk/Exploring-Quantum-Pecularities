# Exploring-Quantum-Peculiarities

In this Project,

1) Proved the utility of spontaneous parametric down-conversion(SPDC) as a source of single photons.

2) Did nonlocality tests, probing quantum entanglement.

3) Performed quantum state tomography for various two-qubit states by virtue of the density matrix formalism.
